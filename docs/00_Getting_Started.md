Welcome to the TodayCMS docs. This site contains documentation and examples of how to use TodayCMS, the powerful Content Management System. Here is a breakdown of what this documentation will cover.

## API
The api is the server endpoint for creating, reading, updating and deleting objects from collections in the database.

##Config
The config is used to define the objects in your collections in json.

## Editor
The editor is an embedable tool, for creating and updating objects in a collection.

## PHP SDK
The PHP SDK is a file called connector.php that makes it easier to work with the API. It contains helpers and functions that map to API calls.
